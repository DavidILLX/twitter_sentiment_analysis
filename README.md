Twitter Sentiment Analysis using BERT &amp; K-Means Clustering
This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using BERT embeddings and unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering). The workflow includes:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and tokenizing tweets
BERT Embeddings: Converting tweets into vector representations
Unsupervised Learning: Using K-Means to group tweets based on sentiment
Visualization: PCA for dimensionality reduction and cluster plotting
ETL Pipeline: Exporting results in JSON and PDF formats
